## Overview ![paw](web/img/favicon/favicon-16x16.png)
**CMS Project Leder Tatze**

For this school project i had to program a cms by myself.
I have decided to revise and add to my existing "Leder LARP Tatze" page.
The goal is a simple CMS where you can delete, edit and add things.

The page changes from Leder LARP Tatze to Leder Tatze this makes the whole thing a bit more general. 
Also, the site is now being set up with Bootstrap and Mobile first.

## Project structure ![paw](web/img/favicon/favicon-16x16.png)  
**PHP**  
my php code is unfortunately a mishmash between object-oriented programming and not object-oriented programming. 
this for the reason that I can not yet determine the difference everywhere and thus also could not locate with examples 
from the internet whether this is object-oriented or not.

Every file that outputs HTML is in the folder `templates`.  
Every file that does something in the Database is in the folder `modules`.  
Every file that controls something is in the folder `controllers`.

## Installation and system ![paw](web/img/favicon/favicon-16x16.png)  
**In this project the following languages and libraries were used:**
 * PHP
 * js and jquery
 * css/ scss
 * HTML5
 * gulp
 * Bootstrap
 * git
 
To edit or change the project open gitBash or any other console in the root folder.

In case you haven't already installed npm and node.js globally, please do that first. [link to install npm via node.js ](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)  
   if you are not sure about it run `node -v` and `npm -v` this will tell you which version you have installed, or otherwise if it is not available.

Run `npm install` this command will run the package.json file and thus install gulp and Bootstrap.  
It will create a folder named node_modules.

Because scss is used here, a watcher must be activated. Run `gulp watch`  
 this will now automatically open a browser with a live server of the project.
this command will run the gulpfile.js file and inside it the watch function.

What it actually does is
* it watches for changes in the scss files, takes the scss files, changes those to css add autoprefix an saves them in the css folder
* it takes the created css in the css folder and uglify the file , before it saves it in the min_css folder
* it watches for changes in the html files and updates the live server on it.
* it watches for changes in the js files and updates the live server on it.

Now you can work on this project.
The whole thing is actually just for templateing.
With PHP the whole thing gets a bit more complicated, That's why I did the whole templating with style before I started with PHP. and then only added minor changes.

**To be honest, that's probably what I spent most of my time with.
